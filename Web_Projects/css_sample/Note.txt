Two modifications made to the original file:

(1) Modified the original "content_search_2_tabs.css" in the css folder for better UI

(2) Changed the style sheet in the html file from the local version of Bootstrap css to the dynamic CDN. Pasting that url into a browser and copying the text into a local css file should also work just fine.
